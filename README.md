# QnA
``` plain
"Why is it obfuscated?"

Me: Okay, many people asking this question, the reason why i obfuscate the
    code is because I want to avoid recoding and renaming which ends up 
    selling KawaiiGPT tools under my name and claiming that it belongs to them

"This is obviously a virus or a RAT"

Me: Seriously, i'm enough with this question over time. No, there is no RAT, Spyware,
    Malware, Ransom, etc. Why would i do that? because it's free and obfuscated
    doesn't mean i wanna trap you all, **i wouldn't**. If that wasn't from me
    don't run it or you would fall in a trap. 

"But why is it obfuscated?"

Me: Like what i said earlier, "I want to avoid recoding and renaming which ends up 
    selling KawaiiGPT tools under my name and claiming that it belongs to them".
    Please understand that i wouldn't put a malicious code into my tools/code,
    if somebody said "KawaiiGPT has a virus!!" in Telegram or other please don't
    trust it, maybe they just want to bring down my name or they got the wrong KawaiiGPT
    that is not from me.
```

## Conclusion:
---
I never put any malicious code or even malicious software into my code/tools
if it's obfuscated that means I just want to avoid recoding and selling
